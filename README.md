Module 4 Challenge - JavaScript Fundamentals: Console Finances

## Description

"Lubomila's Console Finances" is a weekly challenge,which shows the creating of code for analyzing the financial records of a company. My tasks is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following - the total number of months,the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period, the average of the changes in Profit/Losses, the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease in losses.

## Usage
The list shows what steps were made to complete the challenge:
- To calculate the total amount of months, I used iteration.  Here, the "for" statement declares the variable i and initializes it to 0. It checks that i is less than the number of the array, performs the succeeding if statement, and increments i by 1 after each pass through the loop.
- To calculate the net total amount of Profit over the entire period, I used constants and iteration.
- To get to the total net amount of Losses over the entire period, I used constants to create an array with all of the losses numbers and constants to reach the final amount. To round down the final number I used "Math.floor".
- In order to reach the final amount of Greatest Increase and Decrease, I used constants, if statement and map.
